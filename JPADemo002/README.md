Dogservice 002 is a combination of REST service and web service: • it connects to a mySQL database with user imdbuser and password password • database is IMDB001 • it is a combination of REST service (returning JSON) and web service (for now just a greeting object)

See https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ See https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-with-spring-data-jpa to be able to understand this first read https://www.amitph.com/spring-boot-rest-service/#2_Mock_Data_Provider

Compared with the last link, the REST web service has been extended with search by name by using a function findDogByName() generated by JPA on the basis of entity and field name.

Retrieve all dogs: http://localhost:8080/dogs

Get dog by id: http://localhost:8080/dogs/3

Add a dog: curl -X POST 
http://localhost:8080/dogs 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-H 'Postman-Token: c6813aea-146c-49cd-9eba-1370aad4bff9' 
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' 
-d '{ "id": 6, "name": "Hooch", "age": 11 }' Delete a dog: curl -X DELETE 
http://localhost:8080/dogs/5 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-H 'Postman-Token: b4b93304-7ee7-45c2-917b-c3bc2985a250' 
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' Get a dog by name: http://localhost:8080/dogs/name/Rikki


Dog can now more easily be added with the form visible through http://localhost:8080/greeting 
nb the id that is input on the form is ignored, auto generated.


Create a new Greeting object using a form, filled in with GET http://localhost:8080/greeting

show the resulting Greeting object, the form has been posted with a post request from the form http://localhost:8080/greeting contents of the object are used by the result web page (result.html) and shows this on the same url (? what exactly happens here?)

Only minor differences in the build.gradle file, just compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa") and compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf")

Didn't manage (yet) to prefix the end points for the greeting in the same way as the end points for the dog stuff have been prefixed in DogsController with @RequestMapping("/dogs")

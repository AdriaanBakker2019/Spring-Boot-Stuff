Dogservice 002 is a combination of REST service and web service: • it connects to a mySQL database with user imdbuser and password password • database is IMDB001 • it is a combination of REST service (returning JSON) and web service (to show pages as front end with Thymeleaf).

See https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ See https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-with-spring-data-jpa to be able to understand this first read https://www.amitph.com/spring-boot-rest-service/#2_Mock_Data_Provider

Compared with the last link, the REST web service has been extended with search by name by using a function findDogByName() generated by JPA on the basis of entity and field name.

Retrieve all dogs: http://localhost:8080/dogs  - uses REST service with JSON
Retrieve all dogs: http://localhost:8080/list - uses controller with thymeleaf - uses JpaRepository to sort by name

Get dog by id: http://localhost:8080/dogs/3

Dog can now more easily be added with the thymeleaf form visible through http://localhost:8080/adddog 


Add a dog: curl -X POST 
http://localhost:8080/dogs 
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
-H 'Postman-Token: c6813aea-146c-49cd-9eba-1370aad4bff9' 
-H 'cache-control: no-cache' 
-d '{ "id": 6, "name": "Hooch", "age": 11 }' 

Delete a dog: curl -X DELETE ...

Show a particular dog: http://localhost:8080/dogs/5 

Get a dog by name: http://localhost:8080/dogs/name/Rikki





Only minor differences in the build.gradle file, just compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa") and compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf")

Didn't manage (yet) to prefix the end points for thymeleaf in the same way as the REST controller has been prefixed
